	The codebase used is a small API for a tiny book database stored in a local XML file.
	The basic services are get, list and search. Here is a short description for the services:

	get
		Usage: /get/@bookid

		Returns with the book record on the given id or with an error message if not found.

		Example: webtest/get/bk101

	list
		Usage: /list[?@filter1=@value1&@filter2=@value2...]

		If used without filters it returns with all the records in the document.
		The filters can be: author, genre, price.
		The service is looking for all the records exactly matching the filters (genre=Fantasy and price=5.95 etc...).

		Example: webtest/list?genre=Fantasy&price=5.95

	search
		Usage: /search[/@scope]?q=@string

		Similar to the list service but it is not testing for full match but tests if the property of the book
		contains the @string parameter. The scope by default contains all the properties. If it is called with a
		defined scope then it looks only in those.
		The scope can contain:author, title, genre, price, publish_date, description separated with + signs.

		Example: webtest/search/title+description?q=Guide


	Set up an apache with php 5 and install the attached code.

	Tasks:
		- get rid of the errors blocking the services
		- finish the get service
		- implement the filter handling for the list service
		- implement the search service

	Extras:
		+ JSON output mode
		+ paging for list and search services


	Good luck!
